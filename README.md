# Blind-Auction-Project
This is a simple Python-based bidding system that simulates an auction environment. 
I built this project to practice basic Python concepts such as dictionaries, loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

In this program, users can repeatedly enter their names and bids, and after all bids are collected,
the system determines who placed the highest bid and declares the winner. 
If there's a tie for the highest bid, the program also detects and reports it as a "Draw."

Key features:
Allows multiple users to place bids.
Dynamically checks for the highest bid.
Displays all participants and their respective bids before announcing the winner.
Simple and interactive command-line interface.
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of data structures like dictionaries and also how to control flow in a program using loops and conditional statements.
